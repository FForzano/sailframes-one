"""Seed/update ``boat_classes`` from three official RYA Portsmouth Yardstick
sources, layered by authority (data/ — all extracted from PDFs/xlsx
published at https://www.rya.org.uk/racing/portsmouth-yardstick):

1. ``rya_py_list_2026.json`` — the current "PN List 2026" (Dinghy + Multi +
   Experimental Numbers sections): classes with a consistent return of
   results this season. Authoritative for everything, including
   ``py_rating``.
2. ``rya_py_limited_data_2026.json`` — the "Limited Data List 2026":
   classes without enough recent returns for the main list. Used only for
   classes NOT already covered by the PN list; its ``py_rating`` is the
   list's own "Last Published Number" (may be old — RYA publishes it as a
   starting point, not a current number). Roughly half its rows have no
   RYA Class ID at all (older/rarer classes never assigned one).
3. ``rya_class_master_2026.json`` — the "Class List Master" (523 class
   configurations, keyed by RYA Class ID): no PY numbers. Used two ways:
   (a) to backfill crew/rig/spinnaker/hull_type when a Limited Data List
   row is missing them and has a matching ID (e.g. "470"/RYA ID 13 has a
   PY number on the Limited Data List but no crew/rig/spinnaker there —
   pulled from the master list instead); (b) every remaining class in the
   master list that has an RYA Class ID but never made either PY list is
   still imported, with ``py_rating`` left ``NULL`` — a class configuration
   is real and worth having in the catalog even with no number yet; an
   admin can fill it in by hand later once one is available.

Only RYA-published fields are ever touched: ``name``, ``rya_class_id``,
``crew_size``, ``rig_type``, ``spinnaker_type``, ``py_rating``, ``hull_type``.
``description``/``logo_id``/``loa_m``/``beam_m``/``sail_area_sqm`` are never
touched — those are admin-filled extras outside the RYA lists' scope, and
this script must not clobber whatever an admin has already entered there.

Idempotent and safe to re-run every time the RYA republishes a list: matches
existing rows by ``rya_class_id`` first, falling back to a case-insensitive
exact ``name`` match for a class created locally (or sourced from the
Limited Data list with no ID) before it had an RYA ID — that class gets
linked, not duplicated. Anything left unmatched is created. If the name
match already carries a *different* RYA Class ID, the row is skipped rather
than silently re-pointing an existing link (happens for a handful of master
rows that share a name with an unrelated already-published class, e.g. two
distinct "Spitfire" configurations — needs a human to disambiguate).

Run with the backend environment configured (DB reachable), e.g. inside the
backend container:

    python scripts/seed_boat_classes.py            # apply
    python scripts/seed_boat_classes.py --dry-run  # preview only
